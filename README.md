It is good practice to create virtual environments for each of your Python projects. You can skip this step, but it is strongly recommended.

$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
Once your virtual environment has been created and activated, you can install the modules needed for this project.

$ pip install flask-rest-jsonapi flask-sqlalchemy
